# Project Euler 036 - Double-Base Palindromes

The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001<sub>2</sub> (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than n, whereas n is between 1000 and 1000000, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)
